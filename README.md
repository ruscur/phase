phase
=====

phase is a codename for my adventures into writing an open source game
in Rust.  I've been meaning to do this for a while, and having it public
from the start helps encourage progress, I think.

There are a few base rules:

 - using SDL2.  I know it's not the most rustic framework, but it is
   battle tested and that means a lot given every time I've tried to
   use piston I have cried.
 - nothing will be here for a while.  I'm going to try to adapt several
   C/C++ SDL tutorials into rust, and just throw the output into this
   repository.  Once I have more of an idea what I'm doing, that'll
   change and maybe I can get some third-party participation.
 - It's called phase because I like the word and it keeps coming up in
   my dreams.

I've tested this on x86_64 Linux and Windows.  Windows was a bit of a pain, see the Windows instructions for rust-sdl2 for details.
